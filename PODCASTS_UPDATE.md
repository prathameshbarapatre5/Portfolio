## Customization Notes

**Important**: I've added placeholder titles and guest names for the podcasts since I couldn't access the specific Spotify episode details. Please update these with:
- Actual episode titles
- Real guest names
- Specific topics discussed
- Exact dates (if available)

To update, simply modify the `podcasts` array in the file:
```typescript
const podcasts = [
  {
    title: "Your Actual Episode Title",
    guest: "Actual Guest Name",
    description: "Actual episode description",
    // ... rest of the properties
  }
]
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Episode Details**: Update with actual episode titles and guests
2. **Embed Players**: Consider embedding Spotify players
3. **Transcript Links**: Add links to episode transcripts if available
4. **Show Notes**: Link to detailed show notes
5. **RSS Feed**: Add podcast RSS feed link
6. **Ratings/Reviews**: Display listener feedback
7. **Season Organization**: Group episodes by season if applicable

Your Articles & Media page now comprehensively showcases your thought leadership through both audio and written content! 🎙️📖🚀
